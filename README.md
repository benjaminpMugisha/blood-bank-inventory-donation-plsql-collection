# Blood Bank & Donation/ Inventory System - PL/SQL Collections & Records 

Problem Statement
Blood Donation Inventory Management with Emergency Response System

Problem:
 A blood bank needs to efficiently manage donation inventory while implementing emergency response protocols for critical blood shortages and donor management.

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates advanced PL/SQL features using a Blood Donation Inventory Management System. The project showcases:
- **Collections**: Associative Arrays, VARRAYS, and Nested Tables
- **Records**: Table-based, User-defined, and Cursor-based Records  
- **GOTO Statements**: Emergency protocols and conditional branching

## Problem Domain
**Blood Donation Inventory Management with Emergency Response**
- Manage donor information and blood inventory
- Process emergency blood requests
- Implement real-time shortage alerts
- Handle complex medical data structures

Specific Challenges:

 Process batches of donor information using collections

 Handle complex medical records as single units

 Implement emergency branching for critical blood shortages

 Manage blood inventory with different collection types

 Generate real-time alerts for low stock levels

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Collections
- **Associative Arrays**: Quick donor lookup by phone number
- **VARRAYS**: Fixed-size blood unit collections
- **Nested Tables**: Dynamic blood type analysis

### 2. Records  
- **Table-based**: Direct database record handling
- **User-defined**: Complex medical profiles and inventory summaries
- **Cursor-based**: Batch processing of critical requests

### 3. GOTO Statements
- Emergency blood shortage protocols
- Conditional branching for critical situations
- Multi-level alert systems
